# Everybody Codes with python

Solutions in Python for the Everybody Codes challenges

## Challenge

[Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes/)

It takes place in November and it is very similar to the Advent of Code.

It counts the time since the moment that the developer opens his quest, and I prefer this behavior.


## Goals

1. Improve my skills with python
2. Spend less time as possible in coding, ignoring readability
